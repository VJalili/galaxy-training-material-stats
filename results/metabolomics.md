- **Mass spectrometry: LC-MS analysis**
  - Pro:
    - This format is much more approachable (esp. for hands-on) than the PDFs at W4M.org. I'm not saying that the PDFs are not helpful or informative (they are), but this is much more suitable for walking through the steps. Also, because it is a "living document", you can improve it in place, and we do not need to look for an updated document somewhere else.  We can always link to one URL when referencing the tutorial.

    - The detailed explanation behind the steps. It was awesome (*2019-09-18 00:00:00*)
    - All the careful and detailed explanations make the training easy to follow (*2019-09-29 00:00:00*)
    - Comprehensive in terms of breadth; hands-on (*2019-10-30 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Document every axis of every panel of Quality_Metrics_figure.pdf, e.g., what are deciles and missing values in the bottom left panel? Put into the description the rationale behind the parameters chosen in Data Filtering (you presented it wonderfully verbally, but I don't find it written into the tutorial). (*2019-07-06 00:00:00*)
