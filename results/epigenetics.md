- **ATAC-Seq data analysis**


- **DNA Methylation data analysis**
  - Pro:
    - explained quite well (*2019-02-28 00:00:00*)
    - The good explanations during hands-on training (*2019-09-26 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - velocity (*2019-02-28 00:00:00*)
    - When the tutorial use the softwares in the galaxy plataform (*2019-07-26 00:00:00*)
    - Maybe too different analysis for one day (HiC and epigentics), maybe a longer session for each would help understanding (*2019-09-26 00:00:00*)

- **EWAS data analysis of 450k data**

  - Con:
    - layout of some tables (*2019-09-11 00:00:00*)

- **Formation of the Super-Structures on the Inactive X**
  - Pro:
    - Clearly explained (*2019-02-11 00:00:00*)
    - the work is well organized, I liked the most questions and answers, also that you also post the output, so we can know that we are going the right direction! (*2019-04-28 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Confusing - somewhere I got lost, I could do what I was asked for, but don't knwo why I did it (*2018-09-18 00:00:00*)
    - Optional Tools and their advantages :) (*2019-02-11 00:00:00*)
    - For example what about single-end data? it will be great to give another example for single-end BAM files? (*2019-04-28 00:00:00*)
    - You put a wrong figure here: Figure 9: Per base sequence quality. It is the same with Figure 3: Per base sequence quality. (*2019-09-27 00:00:00*)

- **Hi-C analysis of Drosophila melanogaster cells using HiCExplorer**
  - Pro:
    - perfect step by step !!!! (*2018-09-18 00:00:00*)
    - Nothing bad, just I do not have sufficient background knowledge to comprehend everything. Nevertheless, very well-structured for a beginner to learn. (*2019-02-28 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - maybe use human data ?? (*2018-09-18 00:00:00*)
    - Speed is too fast (*2018-09-20 00:00:00*)

- **Identification of the binding sites of the Estrogen receptor**
