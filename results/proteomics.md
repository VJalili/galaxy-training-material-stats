- **Annotating a protein list identified by LC-MS/MS experiments**


- **Detection and quantitation of N-termini (degradomics) via N-TAILS**

  - Con:
    - still to complex to make sense (*26/04/2019*)

- **Label-free versus Labelled - How to Choose Your Quantitation Method**
  - Pro:
    - Detailed of both technique are very concise and helpful (*01/06/2019*)
    - The microscopic information (*05/07/2019*)
  - Con:
    - More details could have been added (*05/07/2019*)

- **Peptide and Protein ID using OpenMS tools**
  - Pro:
    - Well explained, great background information - my favourite was the greedy group resolution (*29/09/2018*)

- **Peptide and Protein ID using SearchGUI and PeptideShaker**
  - Pro:
    - Background info such as: The explanation of 'doubtful' for all levels (*03/10/2018*)
    - Tutorial is absolutely awesome! Thaks a lot for the work you made!  (*05/12/2018*)
  - Con:
    - SearchGui crashed with the database containing mycoplasma, with human and crap database it worked (*03/10/2018*)
    - Maybe you could make the tutorial more detailed. Write all the commands exactly as they should be written in the terminal. I catch lots of failures and can't improve them by myself.( (*05/12/2018*)

- **Protein FASTA Database Handling**
  - Pro:
    - Many details and background information (*29/09/2018*)
    - Easily explained with lot of interactive information about publishing data and archiving data analysis  (*04/10/2018*)
    - It is easy to follow. It saved me a lot of time and effort trying to generate this database (*08/11/2018*)
  - Con:
    - Fasta merging parameter How are sequences judged to be unique? should be set to 'Accession only' (*29/09/2018*)
    - A way to check your results are consistent with, for example, a master/reference database. (*08/11/2018*)
