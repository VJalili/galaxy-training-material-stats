    - So mouch (*06/09/2019*)
    - The simplicity and practicality of the tutorial (*11/09/2019*)
    - The step-by-step guidance with explanations. (*11/09/2019*)
    - informative (*12/09/2019*)
  - Con:
    - the clear instruction pattern (*09/09/2018*)
    - Nothing (*08/10/2018*)
    - some buttons do not exist (anymore)? Like in "Look at all your histories" under 3. at the top line there is a "done" button - this was not displayed when I did it. That is not a tragedy but it can be confusing.... (*10/10/2018*)
    - speed (*17/10/2018*)
    - none (*18/10/2018*)
    - There is no answer to the question under the section entitled 'Re-run that tool with changed settings'. A 'Done' button does not appear in the view history screen as well.  (*18/10/2018*)
    - - (*23/10/2018*)
    - You could link to short description of what a fastq format is, etc... and warn that Filterbyquality sometimes is not present. I could not find it. I use FilterFASTQ instead (*29/10/2018*)
    - Nothing (*30/10/2018*)
    - This should be the first tutorial that shows up, even before the longer version as now I would feel more comfortable doing the long one whereas that one was overwhelming at first. (*01/11/2018*)
    - Nothing (*19/11/2018*)
    - everything is ok (*05/01/2019*)
    - I found the boxes around each of the big steps a little distracting. They are not necessary for the transition between the steps. The large headings are enough. (*23/01/2019*)
    - more detail about data set  (*05/02/2019*)
    - Nothing really,  (*12/02/2019*)
    - niks  (*13/02/2019*)

    -  some video lectures of the tutorial may be added  (*07/03/2019*)
    - it would be great if the quality score part is explained more. (*14/03/2019*)
    - Include in the tutorial that you have to validate your email address if you a new galaxy user who just registered. (*18/03/2019*)
    - If the tutorials could be downloadable, it could be a great help (*16/04/2019*)
    - If you make a question, include always the answer with an appropiate explanation to make everything clear. Why in the case you use the 36 filter there are so many reads discarded? Do not Forget most of people is the first time they work with this online tool.   (*22/04/2019*)
    - None (*22/04/2019*)
    - Needs to be updated. I could not follow the tutorial because the tools, the interface, etc. are different (*05/06/2019*)
    - the Filter by quality function was not on the program (*14/06/2019*)
    - none (*21/06/2019*)
    - will not know until I work on my own data (*23/06/2019*)
    - The history names in fig 1 could be showing as the next-analysis and my-analysis. (*28/07/2019*)
    - provide more links so we could be able to try and check if we understand galaxy certainly (*05/08/2019*)
    - NA -thought this was excellent and easy to follow! (*09/08/2019*)
    - multiple ways of importing data in the introduction (*14/08/2019*)
    - In this moment I dont have a suggest maybe with the practiceses (*20/08/2019*)
    - More publicity to make this fantastic site more popular to bioinformatic field (*01/09/2019*)
    - didn't felt need for more info (*06/09/2019*)
    - . (*06/09/2019*)
    - More exploration of the data analysis to aid those who are not familiar with biological data (e.g. brief explanation of FASTQ and how to interpret it) (*11/09/2019*)
    - nothing (*12/09/2019*)

    - Easy setting, sufficient help during the event of the organizers,  (*17/10/2018*)
    - easy to follow individual steps (*22/11/2018*)
    - Easy to follow tutorial (*22/11/2018*)
    - The tutorial. (*20/12/2018*)
    - Step by step introduction and repetition of features (*08/01/2019*)
    - Very clear instruction and step-by-step explanation (*25/02/2019*)
    - It is easy to follow (*25/02/2019*)
    - use of different tools, good explanations (*25/02/2019*)
    - most but if the files that need to be downloaded do not exist at UCSC, this tutorial is useless (*05/03/2019*)
    - short calculation times (*11/06/2019*)
    - I didn't have the time to like it since the intersect command is not working :( (*15/08/2019*)
    - not working with the bedtools intersect intervals (the other tool is currently not working) (*21/08/2019*)
  - Con:
    - maybe by adding more pictures next to the explanations? (*17/09/2018*)
    - More information on the flanking region tool (how it works) (*17/09/2018*)
    - pick a relevant induction based on your needs  (*02/10/2018*)
    - More visual examples (*08/10/2018*)
    - would like to have example outputs for important steps, so if i made a mistake in step 7 i don't have to find out in step 19 and go back to revise everything. I can just use the dummy dataset for step 19 to continue and finish the practice (*17/10/2018*)
    - airconditioning less cold (*17/10/2018*)
    - explaning more explicitly the goal of each individual exercise (*17/10/2018*)
    - short of time to complete the excercise (*17/10/2018*)
    - Chipseq data seems a little more complex than more 1-dimensional seq reads (DNA/RNAseq), so would seem to me that starting with e.g. RNAseq analysis could be more logical  (*22/11/2018*)
    - We did not realize the 00000000rik names were also gene names, so we spent some time thinking we did something wrong... (*22/11/2018*)
    - More practical excercises (*20/12/2018*)
    - some small exercises or quizes (*25/02/2019*)
    - go through the process and correct (*05/03/2019*)
    - I would love it to work, the tools changed in the meanwhile and it need to be updated cause it is not working anymore for some not clear reason . Most probably there is a problem with the UCSC file (I changed any kind of parameter on the interval file and i get always the same error). (*15/08/2019*)
    - Update (*21/08/2019*)

    - If there was a guide to say which tool to use for a specific analysis to be made. Unless I know which tool to look for, I'd be lost (*15/09/2018*)
    - The rate of update of the tutorial (*26/09/2018*)
    - nothing for now (*27/09/2018*)

    - The explanation about the use workflow on Repeats (*07/12/2018*)
    - Galaxy at usegalaxy.org ends up showing "the white screen of death" extremely often (10s of times during following this tutorial). (*14/01/2019*)
    - Should provide practice every step (*10/02/2019*)
    - Fatal error: Exit code 1 () Error running sorter.py Command '(grep '^#' /galaxy-repl/main/files/030/998/dataset_30998511.dat) >> /galaxy-repl/main/files/030/998/dataset_30998729.dat' returned non-zero exit status 1 (*18/04/2019*)
    - Some of the instructions are outdated as newer versions of data in UCSC main have been added, which makes some parts slightly confusing (*25/04/2019*)

    - Adding more examples of its applications and how it is used in real time (*16/05/2019*)
    - I couldn't find a 'display at UCSC browser' option when I get to this step (*29/05/2019*)
    - It would be nice if there is more explanations on the significance of each step and what exactly is being performed when selecting different tools. (*30/05/2019*)
    - Couldn´t really see what the results in the genome browser would tell me and how I apply this for my work.  (*11/06/2019*)

    - Cannot find C2C12 file (*25/02/2019*)
    - One cannot explain an unknown by substituting another unknown.   Therefore do not use abbreviations such as BAM, BED, MAF, VCF etc.  Consider incorporating a complete or partial glossary (*05/06/2019*)
    - RNASeq of C2C12 not available (*22/08/2019*)

  - Con:
    - Galaxy says it has ran the workflow, but nothing happens. (*16/01/2019*)
    - It could be better to put the overlapped extron images here too (*09/04/2019*)

    - nothing I can think of (*22/01/2019*)
    - I would suggest to make the videos longer and theory shorter. (*30/04/2019*)

    - add example with bowtie2  (*24/05/2019*)
    - Please date this content.  Is it out of date?  It does not mention kallisto, sleuth or salmon.  Are these available in a cloud somewhere?  Are they better? (*27/08/2019*)
