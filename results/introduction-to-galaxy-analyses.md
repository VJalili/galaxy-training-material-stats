    - some buttons do not exist (anymore)? Like in "Look at all your histories" under 3. at the top line there is a "done" button - this was not displayed when I did it. That is not a tragedy but it can be confusing.... (*2018-10-10 00:00:00*)
    - speed (*2018-10-17 00:00:00*)
    - none (*2018-10-18 00:00:00*)
    - There is no answer to the question under the section entitled 'Re-run that tool with changed settings'. A 'Done' button does not appear in the view history screen as well.  (*2018-10-18 00:00:00*)

    - If you make a question, include always the answer with an appropiate explanation to make everything clear. Why in the case you use the 36 filter there are so many reads discarded? Do not Forget most of people is the first time they work with this online tool.   (*2019-04-22 00:00:00*)
    - None (*2019-04-22 00:00:00*)
    - Needs to be updated. I could not follow the tutorial because the tools, the interface, etc. are different (*2019-06-05 00:00:00*)
    - the Filter by quality function was not on the program (*2019-06-14 00:00:00*)
    - none (*2019-06-21 00:00:00*)
    - will not know until I work on my own data (*2019-06-23 00:00:00*)

    - More publicity to make this fantastic site more popular to bioinformatic field (*2019-09-01 00:00:00*)
    - didn't felt need for more info (*2019-09-06 00:00:00*)
    - . (*2019-09-06 00:00:00*)
    - More exploration of the data analysis to aid those who are not familiar with biological data (e.g. brief explanation of FASTQ and how to interpret it) (*2019-09-11 00:00:00*)
    - nothing (*2019-09-12 00:00:00*)

    - use of different tools, good explanations (*2019-02-25 00:00:00*)
    - most but if the files that need to be downloaded do not exist at UCSC, this tutorial is useless (*2019-03-05 00:00:00*)
    - short calculation times (*2019-06-11 00:00:00*)
    - I didn't have the time to like it since the intersect command is not working :( (*2019-08-15 00:00:00*)
    - not working with the bedtools intersect intervals (the other tool is currently not working) (*2019-08-21 00:00:00*)

    - Clear and easy to follow (*2019-09-29 00:00:00*)

    - short of time to complete the excercise (*2018-10-17 00:00:00*)
    - Chipseq data seems a little more complex than more 1-dimensional seq reads (DNA/RNAseq), so would seem to me that starting with e.g. RNAseq analysis could be more logical  (*2018-11-22 00:00:00*)
    - We did not realize the 00000000rik names were also gene names, so we spent some time thinking we did something wrong... (*2018-11-22 00:00:00*)
    - More practical excercises (*2018-12-20 00:00:00*)
    - some small exercises or quizes (*2019-02-25 00:00:00*)
    - go through the process and correct (*2019-03-05 00:00:00*)
    - I would love it to work, the tools changed in the meanwhile and it need to be updated cause it is not working anymore for some not clear reason . Most probably there is a problem with the UCSC file (I changed any kind of parameter on the interval file and i get always the same error). (*2019-08-15 00:00:00*)
    - Update (*2019-08-21 00:00:00*)
    - I recommend adding more images of the data being analysed for part 2 section Repeat workflow, 'Run a workflow with changed settings'. This would have been helpful to be able to compare my results with the guides. (*2019-09-28 00:00:00*)
    - Create peak summit file sections does not run. (*2019-09-29 00:00:00*)

    - nothing for now (*2018-09-27 00:00:00*)
    - Nothing (*2018-10-31 00:00:00*)
    - One could add a section describing the use of multiple datasets, tags, etc. (*2018-11-04 00:00:00*)
    - Including some assignment or home work (*2018-11-28 00:00:00*)
    - update some of the options and screenshots to be consistent with the latest version of Galaxy (*2018-11-28 00:00:00*)
    - The explanation about the use workflow on Repeats (*2018-12-07 00:00:00*)
    - Galaxy at usegalaxy.org ends up showing "the white screen of death" extremely often (10s of times during following this tutorial). (*2019-01-14 00:00:00*)
    - Should provide practice every step (*2019-02-10 00:00:00*)
    - Fatal error: Exit code 1 () Error running sorter.py Command '(grep '^#' /galaxy-repl/main/files/030/998/dataset_30998511.dat) >> /galaxy-repl/main/files/030/998/dataset_30998729.dat' returned non-zero exit status 1 (*2019-04-18 00:00:00*)
    - Some of the instructions are outdated as newer versions of data in UCSC main have been added, which makes some parts slightly confusing (*2019-04-25 00:00:00*)
    - this is a bit too long (*2019-04-25 00:00:00*)
    - I do not know - I know only Biopython (*2019-05-01 00:00:00*)
    - # No results returned from query. (*2019-05-15 00:00:00*)
    - Adding more examples of its applications and how it is used in real time (*2019-05-16 00:00:00*)
    - I couldn't find a 'display at UCSC browser' option when I get to this step (*2019-05-29 00:00:00*)
    - It would be nice if there is more explanations on the significance of each step and what exactly is being performed when selecting different tools. (*2019-05-30 00:00:00*)
    - Couldn´t really see what the results in the genome browser would tell me and how I apply this for my work.  (*2019-06-11 00:00:00*)
    - by giving more free tutorials (*2019-07-06 00:00:00*)
    - Maybe add more examples, more explanations on the datasets used.  (*2019-08-02 00:00:00*)
    - More clarity in instructions for the solution to the question; "For the first 3 exons in your file, what is the number of SNPs that fall into that exon?" The description of the solution steps was unclear. (*2019-08-09 00:00:00*)

    - Nothing - I thought it was great! :) (*2019-08-28 00:00:00*)
    - Nothing (*2019-08-28 00:00:00*)
    - the tiny mistakes (*2019-08-28 00:00:00*)
    - Ability to zoom on the graphics (*2019-09-06 00:00:00*)
    - none (*2019-09-10 00:00:00*)
    - Its good (*2019-09-12 00:00:00*)
    - probably covers the basics pretty well but would like more personally (*2019-10-07 00:00:00*)
    - other cases (*2019-10-08 00:00:00*)
    - nothing (*2019-10-14 00:00:00*)
    - The display is too wide when you want to juxtapose the tutorial window with galaxy (*2019-11-01 00:00:00*)
    - Maybe automattically update to gencode updates, there is no genecode v29 anymore (*2019-11-21 00:00:00*)

- **Galaxy 101 for everyone**
  - Pro:
    - The hands on exercises (*2019-11-11 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - The images about the diamonds are not very legible (*2019-11-11 00:00:00*)

- **IGV Introduction**
  - Pro:
    - That there was a tutorial to begin with!   Thank you! (*2019-06-05 00:00:00*)
    - step by step instructions for students (*2019-10-16 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Actually show some use-cases (there is only one and i am unable to load ENCODE data) (*2019-01-15 00:00:00*)
    - Cannot find C2C12 file (*2019-02-25 00:00:00*)
    - One cannot explain an unknown by substituting another unknown.   Therefore do not use abbreviations such as BAM, BED, MAF, VCF etc.  Consider incorporating a complete or partial glossary (*2019-06-05 00:00:00*)
    - RNASeq of C2C12 not available (*2019-08-22 00:00:00*)
    - C2C12 no longer exists.  Also the Sashimi plot does not look like the curved image shown and thus confusing to the student. (*2019-10-16 00:00:00*)

- **Introduction to Genomics and Galaxy**
  - Pro:
    - very detailed and easy to follow, thank you (*2018-09-15 00:00:00*)
    - Broke down the concepts well. Introduced ideas one  step at a time with good explanations that minimized jargon. And worked to make concepts tangible with hands on use of Galaxy. (*2019-02-28 00:00:00*)
    - very clear and easy to follow (*2019-04-09 00:00:00*)
    - It is hands-on approach (*2019-10-25 00:00:00*)
    - It was very easy to follow. (*2019-10-31 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Galaxy says it has ran the workflow, but nothing happens. (*2019-01-16 00:00:00*)
    - It could be better to put the overlapped extron images here too (*2019-04-09 00:00:00*)
    - intersect never worked (*2019-08-22 00:00:00*)
    - Update the intersect phase since that tool is no more available (*2019-08-23 00:00:00*)
    - the intersect tool gives an infinite loop.  The annotations changed on UCSC,  "table: Comprehensive (wgEncodeGencodeCompV24" instead of "table: known genes" (*2019-09-24 00:00:00*)
    - Make it a bit more in-depth (*2019-10-25 00:00:00*)

- **NGS data logistics**

    - Explanation of theoretical basics. Links to additional resources. (*2019-01-17 00:00:00*)
    - awesome and answered many of the questions in my head (*2019-01-22 00:00:00*)
    - I liked the videos. (*2019-04-30 00:00:00*)
    - the explanation part (*2019-05-23 00:00:00*)
    - all of it (*2019-05-24 00:00:00*)
    - Anyone could have understood what it has been explained!! (*2019-06-03 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - not as detailed and easy to follow as the first tutorials, examples not well shown (*2018-09-16 00:00:00*)
    - not as detailed and easy to follow as the first tutorials, examples not well shown (*2018-09-16 00:00:00*)
    - not as detailed and easy to follow as the first tutorials, examples not well shown (*2018-09-16 00:00:00*)
    - very good (*2018-09-27 00:00:00*)
    - I don't see the files name as sample1-r.fq.gz to sample 4 to download and do that practically. However, I do understand the video and it was very helpful (*2018-11-03 00:00:00*)

    - nothing I can think of (*2019-01-22 00:00:00*)
    - I would suggest to make the videos longer and theory shorter. (*2019-04-30 00:00:00*)
    - it is nice (*2019-05-23 00:00:00*)

    - Please date this content.  Is it out of date?  It does not mention kallisto, sleuth or salmon.  Are these available in a cloud somewhere?  Are they better? (*2019-08-27 00:00:00*)
    - You could make the tutorial with the same files (*2019-10-28 00:00:00*)

- **R basics in Galaxy**
  - Pro:
    - Easy to follow (*2019-10-09 00:00:00*)
    - Very thorough (*2019-10-09 00:00:00*)
  - Con:
    - Some variable names are not copied right in a few hands-on sections (ie chromosomes_2 and snp_chromosomes_2 under coerce values) (*2019-10-09 00:00:00*)
